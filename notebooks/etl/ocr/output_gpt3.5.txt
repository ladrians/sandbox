There are mentions of being able to customize the dashboard yourself by selecting different information and design. A straightforward-to-use and intuitive layout is preferred, which makes it easy to find important features and services — people dislike over-cluttered spaces. HIT ASSES. We know from previous projects that the use of modern fonts, high-quality imagery, and attention to visual detail is expected and this is reinforced yet again - the dashboard should read as an extension of the brand, not an afterthought. 18 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024.

UAE. INFINITI Alliance Internal. WHILE THE PRIMARY DEMAND IS TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTIONALITY, THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE THE DASHBOARD MORE INSPIRATIONAL. PEOPLE PREDOMINANTLY SEEK CAR-SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE. As INFINITI is a luxury brand, people expect the functionality of their ownership dashboard to be on the next level - hyper-personalization and synchronisation are ways to achieve this. This should be the focus of the page, as it is the main reason why people revisit it. “Having membership and other events information readily available on the dashboard... BUT EXPRESS CURIOSITY TO ORGANICALLY could help increase member engagement and LEARN MORE ABOUT THE BRAND. However, customers also see the ownership dashboard as a place to learn and engage more with the brand, on their own terms (as opposed to a newsletter).

INFINITI 20 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024 Alliance Internal 6. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
CENTRAL HUB FOR ALL KEY CAR INFO  

Customers’ expectations around an ownership dashboard are mainly focused on easy information gathering. Being able to access key facts and dates around their car purchase is paramount; the dashboard is less considered a space they'd use for exploration and inspiration.  

22 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory  
THE FACTS AT A GLANCE  

Functionalities which gather all required info around the car (specifics, manuals, maintenance, finance etc.) are top of mind, and essential to any car owner. Other information is deemed less relevant. While it's appealing to book test drives and track orders on the dashboard, these functionalities quickly feel irrelevant post-delivery.  

“A PA FOR YOUR CAR"  

In an ideal world, the dashboard would remove any required headspace related to car admin work. Customers would like the system to know about upcoming service appointments and remind them automatically, as if it was fulfilling a role of a personal assistant.  

19th March 2024  
WAYS TO EXPLORE A PREMIUM FEEL  

While owners will predominantly use the ownership dashboard for functional purposes, there are ways to include a luxury feel. This can be achieved through a highly personalized display, a sleek aesthetic as well as through the inclusion of INFINITI-specific perks.  

INFINITI Alliance Internal THESE ARE THE NEXT STEPS INFINITI SHOULD TAKE TO MAKE THEIR OWNERSHIP DASHBOARD OFFERING A SUCCESS: WAYS TO WOW: app - be it car operation and information (which should take centre-stage) as well as appointment scheduling. The option to synchronize their personal calendar with their ownership account should also be a consideration. Show me you know me: people showed interest in a wide range of information around their car purchase. Include all the proposed functionalities as customers found them all to be value adding. Functionalities that become less relevant over time (test drive etc.) can fade into the background once the car is purchased. While a section around car enhancements is appreciated, the dashboard should not feel like a sales channel for INFINITI. POU Recognise and appreciate the owner: independent of the membership program, owners would expect certain perks being offered to them for being an INFINITI brand purchaser. Include a space on the dashboard which informs customers on upcoming releases and events, brand news and the membership. ay Less is more: people want full integration, so offer owners everything they need in one.
