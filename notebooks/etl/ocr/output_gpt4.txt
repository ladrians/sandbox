(TP) INFINITI Alliance Internal 1. Objectives and Approach SUMMARY BACKGROUND & APPROACH  

BACKGROUND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE  

Nissan is currently developing a new design and offering for their ownership dashboards, which will inspire the INFINITI dashboard as well. This research will seek to understand how relevant the features of the Nissan dashboard are and how they can be expanded to better suit a more demanding customer base. 

We will also seek to uncover further expectations that consumers have of a tool like this, and any functions, luxury, or technology additions that are expected. 

The objectives are to:

* Identify what kind of information and actions customers would like to access from this dashboard.
* Understand which of the Nissan dashboard functionalities matter most and are most relevant to customers.
* Identify ways in which the INFINITI membership could help in the process of establishing clear guidance on how to elevate the Nissan dashboard functionalities and design to make it a more engaging space for luxury customers, as well as understanding how to best integrate the membership experience into the dashboard.
* Explore ways to expand the functionalities to make different elements feel more INFINITI-specific.

INFINITI Alliance Internal 2. Feedback on Proposed Functionalities AN OWNERSHIP DASHBOARD IS PREDOMINANTLY EXPECTED TO BE A FUNCTIONAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE. UNPROMPTED, THESE ARE CUSTOMERS’ MAIN PRIORITIES IN A DASHBOARD: 

- Product-specific information such as detailed real-time car specifications, user manuals, warranty details, and troubleshooting guides for their vehicle. 

- Financial overview including loan balances, payment details and schedules, and expenses. 

- Support: Access to FAQs, customer support contacts, and possibly chatbots for immediate assistance. 

In the US, several customers also would expect to visit the dashboard for order updates before receiving their car. It is worth considering making the dashboard a single source of truth. Our app observatory project for Nissan highlights which advanced apps are doing this well. 

INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024 

“I expect to see all of my technical settings in regards to my car such as tire pressure and oil change status. I would also like to see my financial details such as the date of my last payment." 

“My ideal ownership dashboard combines ease of use with comprehensive information. Its features include comprehensive tracking of the car, with statistics on maintenance and engine condition. I can track previous service requests and repairs, including cost and parts used. It provides information on insurance, fees, and taxes, with customized alerts for maintenance and notifications of potential issues.” 

UAE INFINITI Alliance Internal THE IDEAL OWNERSHIP DASHBOARD HAS ALL CAR-RELATED FUNCTIONS TOGETHER IN ONE PAGE

Ideally, customers would want the following from their ownership dashboard: 

"A dashboard should be a page which contains all information about a user, such as their profile details, customized preferences and categories. This includes and navigates to different sections of the website linking to different products and services. A notification icon is also necessary to inform users of newly launched services and latest development."

* Intuitive interface displaying all information on a single page, with key functionalities being prioritized
* Opt-in real-time alerts and notifications for vehicle recalls, maintenance updates, and other important information
* Details about loyalty points, membership levels, and special offers or incentives
* Most assume they'll access their account over their phone/app, so smartphone integration is crucial

This aligns with Nissan's wider one app strategy: it reinforces that a well-functioning dashboard is foundational to an engaging app. 

“A smart 1-click, easy, connected feature."

INFINITI Dashboard Observatory  

CUSTOMERS DISLIKE THESE FUNCTIONALITIES, BECAUSE:  

- Test drives: similarly to track my order, this functionality loses relevance once the car is purchased  
- Track my order: only useful during car purchase  
- Recommended for your car: Perceived as irrelevant or an upselling strategy by some  

The scores were less pronounced as when it came to most important, indicating that all these functionalities have a space on the dashboard  

19th March 2024  

In their words...  

“After my car is delivered, I would not need to track its order progress anymore. Additionally, I would be able to find most of the information I need about my car through the other functionalities, like "My cars.” - US  

“Booking test drives is not that important after the initial purchase to me. And even if I do want to have a driving experiences, it's possible to schedule appointments directly without the need to refer to the dashboard.” - UAE  

INFINITI Alliance Internal TO MAKE THE DASHBOARD A PLACE OWNERS REGULARLY ENGAGE WITH, IT NEEDS TO MAKE LIFE TANGIBLY EASIER FOR THEM - ALL IN ONE PLACE. 

On numerous occasions, customers emphasized the preference and importance of having all information in a single page, instead of different accounts/apps.

"REMOVES MY HEADACHE" 

Key dates as well as reminders were repeatedly praised as crucial for adding real value to car owners. People feel this will take the chore element out of car ownership, and therefore minimises pain points. 

19th March 2024 

"SUPER RELEVANT" 

Customers are quite strict with which content they deem relevant for their ownership dashboard, namely car-specific information. The dashboard should not become overcrowded. 

INFINITI Alliance Internal 4. EXPANSION AND IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE THE DASHBOARD TRULY SPECIAL, IT SHOULD FUNCTION AS A PERSONAL ASSISTANT FOR YOUR CAR. CUSTOMERS WANT THE DASHBOARD TO WORK FOR THEM AND HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR TIME EFFICIENTLY. 

- Reminders about upcoming maintenance/ required servicing with the possibility to schedule those within the dashboard. 
- Integration with technology, such as phone synchronization and automatic updates without glitches; this builds on the desire for having everything in one place. 

Any innovation that eliminates extra steps and frees up headspace is perceived as luxurious. Several also have the expectation that a luxury brand should offer owner-exclusive events etc. They would also want to use the dashboard to stay informed on those. 

14 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024 

In their words... 

“My initial thoughts are that it needs to be segmented out into the most optimal type of information that I would need. I think that's important so then I can keep track of everything and integrate it into my own personal schedule.” - US 

“I would want my dashboard to help me stay on top of any scheduled maintenance dates as well as any upcoming payments. People are busy and tend to forget so it would be great to have an occasional reminder.” - UAE 

INFINITI Alliance Internal Without being prompted, some customers voiced expectations for the dashboard to inform them about the wider ownership experience: 

“I'm missing a section with more perks! Events, discounts, partnerships with luxury brands." - US 

“I would expect to also see icons with details of activities I can subscribe to in order to enjoy benefits and perks available for ownership." - US 

“This section would also provide access to reviews from other customers, fostering a community-driven approach. Additionally, the dashboard should seamlessly integrate with other services relevant to the product, such as warranty registration, loyalty programs, and suggestions for related accessories." - UAE 

“The perfect dashboard includes information like your membership level, any points or loyalty information, upcoming purchases or events (like an appointment or trip if it's travel related) or current subscriptions." - US 

Infiniti Dashboard Observatory, 19th March 2024, Alliance Internal. PERSONALISATION IS A POPULAR WAY TO ELEVATE AN OWNERSHIP DASHBOARD TO MAKE IT FEEL MORE PREMIUM. BOTH AUTOMATIC AND ENABLED PERSONALISATION ARE WELL LIKED. 

In their words: 

“Enhancing my dashboard might include reminding me of bespoke events like luxury automotive shows, VIP test-drive invitations, or exclusive INFINITI owner events in my area. This would contribute to a more distinguished and upscale experience.” - UAE 

Tips for car maintenance and an enhanced driving experience, based on the product they own. 

Personalized recommendations such as accessory and add-ons for their vehicle but also beyond (such as events etc.) For example, it would be great to have personalized recommendations or tips based on the product I own. It could suggest accessories or compatible products that might enhance my overall experience. 

Customize the homepage to individual needs - this could be around alerts but also e.g. the colour scheme. - US 

(TP) 16 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024 INFINITI Alliance Internal US AND UAE SPECIFIC NUANCES GIVE AN INDICATION OF WHAT MARKETS APPRECIATE IN PARTICULAR 

In the US, customers would like synchronization to go further. Some customers would like even more synchronisation: they suggest the ability to record maintenance performed outside of the dealership and have all vehicle information available in one place, having one place for all car history. 

In the UAE, safety and chatbots are wanted. Adding a car security information section in case of accidents or emergencies, as well as the possibility to track their vehicle on the dashboard is suggested. UAE customers appreciate their problems solved immediately; an integrated live chat option is suggested by several.

INFINITI Alliance Internal ATTENTION TO DETAIL ON THE VISUAL LOOK AND FEEL IS EXPECTED FROM A PREMIUM BRAND

THE DASHBOARD'S IDEAL LOOK AND FEEL: 

People prefer the dashboard to have a neutral colour scheme, matching the INFINITI website, to create a premium look. There are mentions of being able to customize the dashboard yourself by selecting different information and design. A straightforward-to-use and intuitive layout is preferred, which makes it easy to find important features and services. People dislike over-cluttered spaces. 

We know from previous projects that the use of modern fonts, high-quality imagery, and attention to visual detail is expected and this is reinforced yet again - the dashboard should read as an extension of the brand, not an afterthought. 

18 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024 

In their words...

“I think if I were to design it, it would feel customized and tailored to each customer. So, it feels more personal and like we truly care for each customer individually." - US 

“Your Cars: Enhancing this section by incorporating high-resolution images, detailed specifications, and customization options could elevate the presentation, providing users with a visually rich and luxurious experience." - UAE 

INFINITI Alliance Internal While the primary demand is to enhance the functionality, there are ways to make the dashboard more inspirational. People predominantly seek car-specific information and assistance. As INFINITI is a luxury brand, people expect the functionality of their ownership dashboard to be on the next level - hyper-personalization and synchronization are ways to achieve this. This should be the focus of the page, as it is the main reason why people revisit it. 

"Having membership and other events information readily available on the dashboard could help increase member engagement and express curiosity to organically learn more about the brand." 

However, customers also see the ownership dashboard as a place to learn and engage more with the brand, on their own terms (as opposed to a newsletter). Therefore, a section around new innovations and upcoming events should be included. 

19th March 2024 
INFINITI 
INFINITI Dashboard Observatory Alliance Internal Including the membership on the dashboard could be a way to make it more engaging, but elevation is key. This should be included along with the information on the dashboard. Having a designated space for the specific membership could be beneficial for the following reasons:

- People see it as part of their purchase, and therefore it could lead to better organization.
- Customers might feel special and dedicated, as this would come at an extra cost, and it goes with the rest of the provided owner information.
- The membership space should maintain a feeling of exclusivity, making it the easiest way to access it and feel elevated from non-members.

Consider integrating the membership under an exciting banner, making people who didn't opt-in feel like they are missing out. While ease of access definitely trumps other considerations, there is still demand to make members feel special.

Q12 [SS]: Do you think the management of this membership (membership access, events, status) should be included on the dashboard? (n=63)

INFINITI Dashboard Observatory 19th March 2024 Alliance Internal (n=6) 6. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: CENTRAL HUB FOR ALL KEY CAR INFO

Customers’ expectations around an ownership dashboard are mainly focused on easy information gathering. Being able to access key facts and dates around their car purchase is paramount; the dashboard is less considered a space they'd use for exploration and inspiration.

22 INFINITI Dashboard Observatory

THE FACTS AT A GLANCE

Functionalities which gather all required info around the car (specifics, manuals, maintenance, finance etc.) are top of mind, and essential to any car owner. Other information is deemed less relevant. While it's appealing to book test drives and track orders on the dashboard, these functionalities quickly feel irrelevant post-delivery.

“A PA FOR YOUR CAR"

In an ideal world, the dashboard would remove any required headspace related to car admin work. Customers would like the system to know about upcoming service appointments and remind them automatically, as if it was fulfilling a role of a personal assistant.

19th March 2024

WAYS TO EXPLORE A PREMIUM FEEL

While owners will predominantly use the ownership dashboard for functional purposes, there are ways to include a luxury feel. This can be achieved through a highly personalized display, a sleek aesthetic as well as through the inclusion of INFINITI-specific perks.

INFINITI Alliance Internal THESE ARE THE NEXT STEPS INFINITI SHOULD TAKE TO MAKE THEIR OWNERSHIP DASHBOARD OFFERING A SUCCESS:

WAYS TO WOW: The app should focus on car operation and information, which should take centre-stage, as well as appointment scheduling. The option for owners to synchronize their personal calendar with their ownership account should also be a consideration.

SHOW ME YOU KNOW ME: People showed interest in a wide range of information around their car purchase. Include all the proposed functionalities as customers found them all to be value adding. Functionalities that become less relevant over time (like test drive) can fade into the background once the car is purchased. While a section around car enhancements is appreciated, the dashboard should not feel like a sales channel for INFINITI.

RECOGNISE AND APPRECIATE THE OWNER: Independent of the membership program, owners would expect certain perks being offered to them for being an INFINITI-brand purchaser. Include a space on the dashboard which informs customers on upcoming releases and events, brand news and the membership.

LESS IS MORE: People want full integration, so offer owners everything they need in one place.
